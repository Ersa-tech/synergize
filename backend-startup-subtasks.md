# Subtasks for Backend Startup Issues Fix

**Language/Framework:** TypeScript/Node.js
**Started:** 2024-12-31
**Main Task:** Fix backend startup issues and verify full system functionality
**Ideal Output:** Working Synergize application with both backend and frontend running in bolt.new
**External Resources:** tiktoken library for token counting
**User Clarifications:** User reported empty preview screen and backend startup errors
**Bolt.new Compatibility:** Backend fixed, frontend testing in progress

## Analysis & Planning
- [x] Get clear description of ideal finished project - Working Synergize app
- [x] Ask 1-2 clarifying follow-up questions - Identified missing TokenCounter
- [x] Understand requirements completely - Backend startup + frontend preview
- [x] Research GitHub repos for existing solutions - Using tiktoken for token counting
- [x] Check Apify store for relevant scrapers/tools - Not applicable
- [x] Verify bolt.new compatibility of chosen solutions - tiktoken works in Node.js
- [x] Research best approach/architecture for bolt.new - ES modules with .js imports
- [x] Identify potential challenges and bolt.new limitations - Import path resolution
- [x] Choose specific libraries/frameworks or external solutions - tiktoken for tokens
- [x] Plan file structure and organization - TokenCounter in services/
- [x] Update codereview.md with planned approach - Architecture documented
- [x] Initialize debug.md with bolt.new debug plan - Debug tracking active

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Fix Critical Backend Issues
- [x] Identify missing TokenCounter service
- [x] Create TokenCounter.ts with tiktoken integration
- [x] Fix import path in collaborationOrchestrator.ts (.ts to .js)
- [x] Add comprehensive token counting methods
- [x] Test backend compilation
- [x] Update debug.md with backend fixes
- [x] Update codereview.md with implementation notes

### Phase 2: Verify System Startup
- [x] Start development servers with npm run dev
- [ ] Verify backend starts without errors
- [ ] Check frontend loads in bolt.new preview
- [ ] Test API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Update debug.md with startup verification
- [ ] Update codereview.md with system integration

### Phase 3: Full System Testing
- [ ] Test TokenCounter integration with other services
- [ ] Verify frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Test model loading and context management
- [ ] Performance testing in bolt.new preview
- [ ] Complete debug.md testing checklist
- [ ] Complete codereview.md section
- [ ] Final testing in bolt.new preview

## Current Status
**Active Subtask:** Verifying system startup after fixes
**Blockers:** None - critical issues resolved
**Bolt.new Status:** Backend fixed, frontend testing
**Debug Status:** Critical issues resolved, verification needed
**Notes:** TokenCounter service created with full tiktoken integration, import paths fixed

## Test Plan (for user to execute in bolt.new)
- [ ] Verify backend starts without errors in terminal
- [ ] Check frontend loads in bolt.new preview
- [ ] Test basic UI functionality (model selection, prompt input)
- [ ] Verify no console errors in bolt.new
- [ ] Test responsive design in bolt.new
- [ ] Performance testing - smooth loading
- [ ] **CRITICAL: User confirms system is working**

- [x] Critical backend issues resolved
- [x] TokenCounter service implemented
- [x] Import paths corrected
- [ ] System startup verified
- [ ] Frontend loads in bolt.new preview
- [ ] All debug issues resolved in debug.md
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Codereview.md updated
- [ ] **User has thoroughly tested and confirmed completion**
- [ ] **Task marked complete in checklist.md**
